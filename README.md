# AI-Guided-Gene-Discovery
This Repo focuses on improving precision medicine for triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) through machine learning (ML)-guided gene expression analysis. We aimed to identify key genes (biomarkers) that can be used for diagnosis, prognosis, and potential drug targets in TNBC, a particularly challenging form of cancer. We utilized publicly available genomic data from GEO and TCGA databases, applying differential gene expression algorithms and various ML-based feature selection methods to pinpoint significant genes.
